# BlastZA Intranet

Fully functional secured web application for bootcamp providers and participants that want a community to upskill in their respective fields as developers, as well as share knowledge and new trends.

### Currently the application allows students to login to the application and land on a dashboard that outlines the following :
  • See what assignments are due, and when
  • See the status of an assignment that is currently under review and if it needs to be refactored
  • Way to submit ( or re-submit ) an assignment for review/code review
  • Getting code feedback from other fellow coders
